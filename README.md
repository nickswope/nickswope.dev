## Repositories
There are two repositories for this project: the [GitLab source repository][gitlab-repo] and the [GitHub mirror][github-repo]. The GitHub mirror is used for the [Code Climate dashboard][cc-dashboard] integration.

All commits to the GitLab `master` branch will trigger an automatic deployment pipeline. Nick is the only one who can commit to `master`. All others must [open a MR][new-mr] in GitLab, which will then be reviewed, approved, and deployed.
